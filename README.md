- 👋 Hi, I’m @StrikerRocket, and I'm French. In my real life, I'm an English teacher in junior high schools and secondary schools.
- 👀 I’m interested in computersand IT, music, electronics (I'm a HAM) and too many other things! I've been toying with computers since the early 80's, on an Apple ][+
my dad built back then, and then later on an Apple //e he bought second hand. I learned a little Pascal, 65C02 assembly language and BASIC. I used to tweak DOS 3.3
to my liking, modifying the nibble tables and so on to "protect" my disks. I did quite a bit of programming in Applesoft BASIC, like programs to solve equation
systems, logbooks for HAMs and a few text based games, so I have a good understanding of the way computers work. Oh, of course I build my computers myself BTW.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning arduino programming and improving my skills with an oscilloscope in electronics. (Amazing what good quality cheap scopes can do now...)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, well, nothing much right now as I don't feel I have the skills yet...
